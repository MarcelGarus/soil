# Soil

Soil is a virtual machine specification that is designed to be easy to implement on typical machines.

To get started, run `make`.
This creates some executables:

- `assemble`: can turn `.recipe` files (Soil assembly) into `.soil` files (Soil binaries).
- `soil-c`: Reference implementation of a Soil interpreter written in C. This is slow.
- `soil-asm`: A Soil JIT compiler written in Assembly. Some syscalls are missing and there are some bugs.
- `soil-rust-compiler`: A Soil compiler to FASM written in Rust.

For example, to run the `hello.recipe`, you can run this:

```sh
cat hello.recipe | ./assemble | ./soil-c
```

## The Anatomy of Soil

Soil consists of three parts of state: registers, memory, and byte code.

Soil is not a von Neumann machine â€“ byte code and memory live in separate worlds.
Byte code can only read/write the memory, not byte code itself.
You can't reflect on the byte code itself, for example, to store pointers to instructions.
This gives Soil implementations the freedom to JIT-compile the byte code on startup.

Soil binaries are files that contain byte code and initial memory.

### Registers

Soil has 8 registers, all of which hold 64 bits.

| name | description              |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| `sp` | stack pointer            |
| `st` | status register          |
| `a`  | general-purpose register |
| `b`  | general-purpose register |
| `c`  | general-purpose register |
| `d`  | general-purpose register |
| `e`  | general-purpose register |
| `f`  | general-purpose register |

Initially, `sp` is the memory size.
All other registers are zero.

### Memory

It also has byte-addressed memory.
For now, the size of the memory is hardcoded to something big.

### Byte Code

Byte code consists of a sequence of instructions.

Soil runs the instructions in sequence, starting from the first.
Some instructions alter control flow by jumping to other instructions.

All instructions start with a byte containing the opcode, followed by the arguments to the operation.
The following instructions are available:

| opcode | mnemonic        | arg 0         | arg 1        | description                                                                                           |

| d8     | pop             | reg: reg      | -            | Runs `load reg sp`, then increases `sp` by 8.                                                         |

To make memorization easier, the first characters of the instruction hex opcodes describe what kind of instruction it is:

- 00: nop
- a*: arithmetic
- b*: binary
- c*: comparisons / conversions
- d*: data operations
- e*: error
- f*: control flow

## Binaries

Soil binaries are stuctured like this:

- magic bytes `soil` (4 bytes)
- the only thing following are sections, each of which has:
  - type (1 byte)
  - length (8 byte), useful for skipping sections
  - content (length parsed above)
- byte code
  - section type `0`
  - length (8 bytes)
  - byte code (length parsed above)
- initial memory
  - section type `1`
  - length (8 bytes)
  - content (length parsed above)
- name
  - section type `2`
  - length (8 bytes)
  - content (length parsed above)
- labels
  - section type `3`
  - length (8 bytes)
  - number of labels (8 bytes)
  - for each label:
    - position in the byte code (8 bytes)
    - label length (8 bytes)
    - label (length parsed above)
- description
  - section type `4`
  - length (8 bytes)
  - content (length parsed above)
